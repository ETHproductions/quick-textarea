# quick-textarea
A quick textarea for using arbitrary string data in the console.

## How to use
Sometimes I want to run some JavaScript code on an arbitrary string. But if the string contains all three different string markers (`"`, `'`, `` ` ``) or a backtick and a newline, entering it into the console can be near impossible. Usually I resort to opening a new `about:blank` tab, adding a textarea to the page, and working with that. quick-textarea aims to make this process much quicker and easier.
1. Go to [bit.ly/q-ta](http://bit.ly/q-ta).
2. Paste whatever data you want into the textarea.
3. Open your browser console.
4. Do whatever you want with the data, which can be accessed with `I.value`.
